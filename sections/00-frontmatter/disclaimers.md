# Disclaimers

1. I am not an expert on any of the subjects in this matter file, so take everything with many grains of salt! There are, without doubt, many errors and inaccuracies in this document, all of which are purely my own fault. Relatedly, some of the material in this document may be outdated.

2. There are many debaters out there who have much stronger and better-developed views on how to approach many of the topics, motions, and clashes contained in this document. I am no "debate expert" or anything close to it, so you should definitely defer to smarter and better-read voices when my notes seem incomplete or low-quality.

3. I've personally found that the process of matter-filing does far more good for your debating than the end-result of matter-filing (i.e., possessing a long collection of notes), so don't consider this document a "substitute" of any kind for doing your own research, as you'll be much better-off putting in the work yourself. I'm releasing this document in the hopes that some people might find these notes useful as a supplementary resource!

4. This document does not reflect my own views/beliefs/opinions; the arguments and briefings in this document are intended solely for the purpose of preparing for BP debate tournaments!
