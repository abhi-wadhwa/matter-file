## Resource Curse

#### TL;DR
The "resource curse" describes how countries rich in natural resources often experience slower economic growth, weaker institutions, and more conflict than resource-poor countries. This paradox arises through Dutch Disease, rentier state dynamics, and price volatility—though some resource-rich countries have successfully avoided these traps.

### Dutch Disease

- **Currency appreciation harms other sectors.** When a dominant export sector (typically minerals or oil) generates massive foreign exchange inflows, demand for the domestic currency sharply increases. This appreciation makes other export sectors (manufacturing, agriculture) less competitive by making their products more expensive for foreign buyers.
  - Named after Netherlands' experience following natural gas discovery in the 1960s
  - The non-resource tradeable sector "deindustrializes" as resources crowd out other industries

### Rentier Effect

- **Reduced incentive for productive diversification.** States that can rely on "economic rents" from natural resources have little incentive to invest in developing dynamic, productive economic sectors.

- **Weakened democratic accountability.** Resource rents reduce states' dependence on domestic taxation. When citizens aren't taxed, they have less bargaining power to demand accountability. Further, taxation historically required states to accept binding constraints on their power in exchange for revenue.
  - "No taxation without representation" works in reverse: no taxation means less pressure for representation

- **Funding for repression.** Unearned rents can easily be channeled into security apparatus or used to silence dissidence through lavish employment opportunities or handouts.

- **Corruption incentives.** The incentive to be corrupt is staggering when governments cannot pay hefty wages and the ability to evade detection is high. The extraction-corruption relationship incentivizes governments to reduce transparency.

### Price Shocks & Volatility

- **Boom-bust fiscal cycles.** In good times, states become fiscally profligate. When commodity prices fall, revenues plummet and resource economies implode. Welfare schemes funded by commodity revenues crumble, causing protests. Sovereign debts become unsustainable when state coffers dry up.

- **Exhaustibility.** Natural resources (oil wells, mineral deposits) will eventually be depleted, leaving economies vulnerable if diversification hasn't occurred.

### Defending Resource-Based Economies

- **Post-colonial states lack alternatives.** Extractive industries may be the best shot at development for countries without industrial bases or human capital.

- **Revenue enables investment.** Commodity revenues give states money needed to fund welfare programs and invest in long-term diversification (e.g., Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030).

- **Sovereign Wealth Funds mitigate volatility.** Norway's $1.4+ trillion oil-based SWF demonstrates how resource wealth can be managed responsibly.

- **Reduced borrowing costs.** Commodity revenues improve credit ratings, reducing borrowing costs in international markets.

- **Strategic leverage.** "Resource nationalism" gives developing economies leverage over the exploitative West.

- **Appreciation has benefits.** Currency appreciation (1) cheapens imports, (2) reduces costs of servicing foreign-currency-denominated debt, and (3) resource industries bring in hard foreign currency.

### Case Studies

- **Norway:** Successfully avoided the curse through strong institutions, transparent governance, and the Government Pension Fund Global (SWF)
- **Venezuela:** Exemplifies the curse—oil dependence, Dutch Disease, institutional decay, and economic collapse following oil price drops
- **Botswana:** Diamond wealth channeled into development with relatively strong institutions
- **Nigeria:** Oil wealth coincided with corruption, conflict, and underdevelopment

### Key Statistics

- Resource-rich developing countries grew 1.7% slower than resource-poor countries (1970-2000)
- Norway's SWF: >$1.4 trillion
- Oil rents as % of GDP in rentier states often exceed 20-40%
