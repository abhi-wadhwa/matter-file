## Interest Rates

#### TL;DR
Central banks use interest rates as their primary tool for managing inflation and economic growth. Raising rates cools inflation but risks recession and financial instability; lowering rates stimulates growth but risks inflation. The optimal policy depends on current economic conditions, inflation expectations, and the lag effects of previous policy decisions.

### FOMC Background

- The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised benchmark interest rates 11 times between March 2022 and mid-2023, from 0% to over 5%
- The federal funds rate target range reached 5.25%-5.50% at its peak
- Annualized inflation (CPI) peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, falling to ~3% by late 2023
- Core inflation (excluding food and energy) remained elevated longer than headline inflation

### For Lower Rates

- **Inflation isn't the top priority anymore.** Inflation is falling in most OECD economies; COVID supply chain disruptions are resolving; China's lockdowns ended; oil prices have cooled; pandemic-era stimulus has worked through the economy; past rate hikes are still coming into effect.
  - Alternative energy investment has surged, reducing energy price pressures

- **Lower rates counterintuitively reduce inflation.** Correcting supply chains is capital-intensive, but higher borrowing costs prevent firms from diversifying supply chains. SMEs are hit hardest by rate hikes, reducing competitiveness and promoting inflationary consolidation.

- **Raising rates hurts consumers.** Higher rates punish middle-class citizens who rely on loans for education, housing, and transportation. Many mortgages are adjustable-rate, so tightening increases costs for homeowners and renters alike. Employees face layoffs when employers can't access affordable short-term financing.

- **Rate hikes cause financial turbulence.** SVB was just the beginning—further hikes strain banks' balance sheets by (1) increasing overnight interbank loan costs, (2) exposing banks to interest rate risk, and (3) depreciating Treasuries on banks' books. Signaling effects cause cascading asset sell-offs.

- **Rate hikes hurt developing economies.** Servicing dollarized debts becomes more expensive when the USD appreciates; unfortunately, rate hikes cause dollar appreciation by increasing yields in US financial markets. Capital flight from low-interest-rate environments crushes emerging markets.

### For Higher Rates

- **Inflation requires further taming.** Red-hot labor markets, resilient consumer demand, and elevated commodity prices suggest underlying inflationary pressures persist. Cutting rates prematurely could reignite inflation and require even more aggressive tightening later.

- **Inflation expectations must be anchored.** Once inflation becomes embedded in wage negotiations and price-setting behavior, it becomes self-fulfilling. Central banks must demonstrate credible commitment to price stability.

- **Asset bubbles need deflating.** Extended periods of low rates inflated asset prices (real estate, equities) beyond fundamental values. Normalization of rates brings more sustainable valuations and reduces systemic risk.

- **Savers and pension funds benefit.** Low rates punish savers and pension funds that rely on fixed-income returns. Higher rates restore income for retirees and reduce pension fund deficits.

- **Financial stability paradox.** While rate hikes cause short-term stress, prolonged low rates encourage excessive risk-taking and leverage, creating larger systemic vulnerabilities.

### Key Statistics

- Peak US inflation (June 2022): 9.1% (CPI)
- Federal funds rate peak: 5.25-5.50%
- SVB failure (March 2023): $209 billion in assets
- Global central bank rate hikes (2022-2023): Most aggressive tightening cycle in 40 years

### Case Studies

- **Silicon Valley Bank (2023):** Collapsed due to interest rate risk exposure—held long-duration Treasuries that depreciated as rates rose, forcing fire sales to meet deposit withdrawals
- **UK Gilt Crisis (2022):** Rapid rate expectations shift caused gilt market dysfunction, forcing Bank of England intervention
- **2024 Emerging Market Stress:** Countries with high dollar-denominated debt faced currency crises as Fed maintained high rates

### Common Clashes

- **Growth vs. Price Stability:** The classic tradeoff
- **Domestic vs. International Effects:** US policy has global spillovers
- **Financial Stability vs. Inflation Control:** Sometimes conflicting objectives
- **Short-term Pain vs. Long-term Gain:** Front-loading vs. gradualism
