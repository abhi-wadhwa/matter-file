## Currency Strength

#### TL;DR
Currency appreciation and depreciation each have distinct economic effects. Stronger currencies reduce import costs but hurt export competitiveness; weaker currencies boost exports but increase import costs and can fuel inflation. The optimal exchange rate policy depends on a country's economic structure, trade balance, and debt composition.

### Currency Appreciation (Stronger Currency)

- **Cheaper imports.** A strong currency reduces the cost of imported goods, benefiting consumers and businesses that rely on foreign inputs. This can reduce inflation.
  - Critical for countries dependent on imported energy, food, or technology

- **Easier debt servicing.** When debts are denominated in foreign currencies (common in developing economies), a stronger domestic currency makes repayment cheaper.

- **Cheaper foreign acquisitions.** Domestic firms can merge with or acquire foreign firms more affordably, facilitating international expansion.

- **Lower input costs.** Domestic firms' resource imports (oil, technology, raw materials) become cheaper, potentially lowering production costs and prices.

### Currency Depreciation (Weaker Currency)

- **Export competitiveness.** A weak currency makes domestic goods cheaper for foreign buyers, boosting export volumes and supporting export-oriented industries.
  - Manufacturing and agricultural exporters benefit most

- **Tourism boost.** Weaker currencies make the country a more attractive tourist destination, supporting hospitality and service sectors.

- **Trade balance correction.** Depreciation reduces imports (now more expensive) and increases exports (now cheaper), helping address trade deficits.
  - The "J-curve effect": trade balance initially worsens before improving as quantities adjust

- **Import substitution.** Higher import prices incentivize domestic production of previously imported goods.

### Key Tradeoffs

- **Inflation risk:** Depreciation raises import prices, potentially fueling cost-push inflation
- **Debt burden:** Depreciation increases the burden of foreign-currency-denominated debt
- **Terms of trade:** Appreciation improves purchasing power for imports but may hurt export industries
- **Competitiveness:** Currency manipulation accusations can trigger trade retaliation

### Policy Tools

- **Interest rate differentials:** Higher rates attract capital inflows, strengthening currency
- **Foreign exchange intervention:** Central banks can buy/sell currency to influence rates
- **Capital controls:** Restricting capital flows to manage exchange rate pressure
- **Currency pegs:** Fixing exchange rate to another currency or basket
